<p>In the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> Douglas Adams succinctly sums up the process that a civilization takes on the path to modernity. The titular guide states “The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases.’For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?’”.  Survival, inquiry, and sophistication is the lowest common denominator used to test a civilization, and by following the logic of Occam's razor in which the most simple solution is often the best. Having the benefit of hindsight we are able to identify our civilizations own survival, inquiry, and sophistication moments. For this context in political theory must simply change the parameters from sustenance to governance. The questions become How can we be governed?, Why do we need to be governed?, Where should governments power come from?. In order to come to any conclusions on these questions they will be tested using the contrasting philosophies of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke.</p>

<p>Thomas Hobbes in his work <em>Leviathan</em> pithily criticized the state of nature as “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short” and that life in this state is utter anarchy. The natural state as Hobbes describes is an extremely bleak existence, but not to be unexpected based on the events of world Hobbes lived in. The years before the publication of <em>Leviathan</em> were particularly brutal the last of the great religious wars wrapped up in Europe, and England had seen a violent and bloody civil war. It is no wonder Hobbes sought out an explanation of human nature, and a way to control it so that lives could be protected from such savagery. Hobbes answered the second question first of why you need governance by summing up that man's greatest enemy is essentially himself, and protection from humanities own exceptional ingenuity in creating new and unique forms of brutality could be the most important commodity in the world. Violent death was the greatest fear of the age and the only way to avoid it was to quit the state of nature. This is an extremely tricky proposition when at the time it was every man for themselves, and law and order was often handle at the expense of whomever had less power, social standing, or wealth. So an effective way must be found to ensure safety of the citizen, which is  how to be governed. </p>

<p>Hobbes offers up a picture of a chosen sovereign. A figure that is much larger than the sum of its parts. Something to lord over the people protecting them from outside incursions by use of force, and subjugating the people to maintain an order of civilization. Essentially Hobbes describes what is now defined as external and internal sovereignty, which are hallmarks of a modern state. Hobbes calls this sovereign the eponymously named Leviathan. Which leads to the final question of where this power of governance is granted from. Hobbes might be the first to put forth and idea that has been echoed by philosophers as varied as Jeremy Bentham and Mister Spock that the greater good of a people group exceed the needs of a minority. Hobbes feels that by giving all power and authority to one ruler whose goal is to ensure the safety and security of the subjects is preferable to the alternative of fending for oneself, which will invariably result in a violent death. In a system of absolute power invested in one entity Hobbes firmly rejects the idea of shared powers. He believe shared powers would undermine the effectiveness of the sovereign, and if the powers of the sovereign were chiseled away then the world would fall back into the horrid state of nature. Essentially the sovereigns power is invested initially in the people, but ultimately becomes the responsibility of the state to maintain it. The state is responsible for all succession planning, and can do as it sees fit to propagate power for itself. The sovereignty of the Leviathan must be assured even to the point of suppression of free speech or ideas. To the modern reader Hobbes is seen as the first realist and seems to be describing what we define as an autocracy, but to the Hobbesian thinker a pragmatic solution to the aforementioned problem of violent death is presented.</p>

<p>John Locke offers a contrasting opinion on the social contract, and one that is near and dear to the hearts of America’s founding fathers who explicitly borrowed his ideas when writing the national documents thus setting the tone of modern democracy. In <em>Two Treatises of Government</em>  Locke eloquently offers a contradiction the Hobbesian idea of the absolutely wretched existence metered out to humanity “The natural state is also one of equality in which all power and jurisdiction is reciprocal and no one has more than another. It is evident that all human beings...are equal amongst themselves”. An alternative social contract is offered up, but the central idea is the same. The people will coalesce to form an entity that is bigger than oneself so that law and order will prevail in protecting what requires protection. It is also necessary to answer why the need to be governed first. Locke cuts to the heart of the matter in stating that it is man in a war against his fellow man, and that all men being equal they must have equal rights to protection from each other. The only way to protect these liberties is to invest power into a government which can protect man and property. The how to be governed under a Lockean philosophy is strictly based on consent. The government must have the consent of the people in order to be considered legitimate. The government exists to not only protect man from fellow man, but also from itself. The Lockean will argue for a minimalist governance and that a government should only be given enough power to do what is necessary for it to be useful. </p>

<p>In modern times these are the checks and balances, separation of powers, and civil liberties that are hallmarks of a liberal democracy. These which are seen as a basic human right were not guaranteed in Locke’s time, and in the <em>Two Treatises of Government</em> would be the first time this viewpoint was espoused. Locke undoubtedly answers where a governmental power come from, and it rest assuredly with the people. Revolution is seen as divine right to Locke. If the terms of the agreement are violated by the chosen government then the people have an obligation to revolt. This check on absolute power assures the people that ultimately the government is meant to work for you, and if it ever stops acting in the peoples best interest then it will need to be the first thing up against the wall when the revolution comes. Thomas Jefferson calls the blood of tyrants the natural manure for the tree of liberty. So an occasional refreshing of a states leadership is not seen as a negative, but instead of killing tyrants the modern democracy holds regular and free elections to ensure a smooth change of power. This political beheading is far more stable than regular upheavals to a state's political system. It allows for the tree of liberty to be pruned and watered, without the worry of it being killed by erroneously removing the system which protects it.</p>

<p>The gulf between Hobbes and Locke is not that difficult to cross, and I think that given the circumstances of the others life it is not difficult to think that one would conclude similarly with the other. I feel that a case could be made for Hobbes being the survivalist, Locke being the inquiry, and the modern political theorist is sophistication in that we do have the benefit of hindsight. If the past truly is prologue we must understand both Hobbes and Locke, and use what we glean from their philosophies to continue on in the tradition of questioning what is to be gained from our own social contracts. </p>
